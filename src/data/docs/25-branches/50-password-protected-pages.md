# Password protected pages

Pages can be protected with **basic auth**. The username is always **user**.

## At the branch level

To enable password protection:

1. Go to your branch settings, toggle on **protected**
1. In the dialog, specify the password (or accept the generated one), click **Save**

<div class="blockquote" data-props='{ "mod": "warning" }'>

Branch passwords are never displayed again, so make sure to save them somewhere.

</div>

To disable protection:
1. Go to your branch settings
1. Toggle off **protected**
