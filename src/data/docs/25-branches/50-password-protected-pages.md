# Password protected pages

Pages can be protected with **basic auth**. The username is always **user**.

## At the site level

To enable password protection:

1. Go to your **site settings**, toggle on **Password protection**
1. In the dialog, specify the password (or accept the generated one), click **Save**

<div class="blockquote" data-props='{ "mod": "warning" }'>

Branch passwords are never displayed again, so make sure to save them somewhere.

</div>

To disable protection:
1. Go to your **site settings*
1. Toggle off **Password protection**


## At the branch level

<div class="blockquote" data-props='{ "mod": "info" }'>

The password set on a branch **overrides** that of the site, if any is defined. 

</div>

To enable password protection:

1. Go to your **branch settings**, toggle on **Password protection**
1. In the dialog, specify the password (or accept the generated one), click **Save**

<div class="blockquote" data-props='{ "mod": "warning" }'>

Branch passwords are never displayed again, so make sure to save them somewhere.

</div>

To disable protection:
1. Go to your **branch settings**
1. Toggle off **Password protection**
