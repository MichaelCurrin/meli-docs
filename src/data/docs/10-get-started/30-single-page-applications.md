# Single Page Applications

Single page applications (SPA) require specific types of redirects. You can enable SPA mode in Meli by going to your site settings. 

By enabling this mode, we configure automatic redirects to `/index.html` when no match is found and add support for Server Side Rendering (SSR).

<div class="blockquote" data-props='{ "mod": "info" }'>

Enabling SPA mode will disable custom `/404.html` pages when your site contains an `index.html`.

</div>
